To address the issues with late binding and implicit type conversion, it's crucial to practice explicit type checking and early binding whenever possible. Here's an improved version:
```vbscript
Dim strNumber As String
Dim intNumber As Integer

strNumber = "10"
intNumber = 10

if CInt(strNumber) = intNumber then
  MsgBox "Equal!" 'This will now only execute after explicit conversion
end if

' Example of early binding (if you know the object type)
Dim objFSO As Object
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
' ... use objFSO methods ...
Set objFSO = Nothing
```
By using `CInt` for explicit conversion and early binding (when feasible), you can enhance the reliability and predictability of your VBScript code, making debugging significantly easier and less prone to unexpected errors.
