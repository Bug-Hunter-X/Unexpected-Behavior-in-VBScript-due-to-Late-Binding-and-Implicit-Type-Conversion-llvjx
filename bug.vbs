Late Binding and Implicit Type Conversion Issues: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug during development. Implicit type conversion can also cause unexpected results if not carefully managed.  For example, comparing a string to a number might not produce the expected boolean result. 
Example:
```vbscript
if "10" = 10 then
  MsgBox "Equal!" 'This will be displayed due to implicit type conversion
end if
```
This might seem harmless, but it can lead to unexpected behavior in more complex scenarios.
